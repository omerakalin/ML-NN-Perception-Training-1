# ML-NN-Perception-Training-1
Machine Learning and Neural Network with Synthetic Datasets


The challenge provides two synthetic datasets, class2_tr and class2_test, containing 220 and 80 samples respectively, each with 2 features and 1 label bit from two classes. The task requires creating a perceptron structure with a single unit, followed by training it with delta rule using gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, and testing it with the test data. The solution also requires generating figures to display data distribution, classification for training and test data, and training error vs iterations. The solution should include source code for training the perceptron with delta rule using both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.
